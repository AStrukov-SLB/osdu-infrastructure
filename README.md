# osdu-infrastructure

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/azure/osdu-infrastructure)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/azure/osdu-infrastructure)

This project is an implementation of the Infrastructure as Code and Pipelines necessary to build and deploy the required infrastructure necessary for the [Open Subsurface Data Universe](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu) (OSDU).  Project Development for this code base is performed and maintained on osdu-infrastructure in [GitHub](http://github.com/azure/osdu-infrastructure) with a mirrored copy located in [GitLab](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform/deployment-and-operations/infrastructure-templates).

All patterns for this have been built and leverage to Microsoft Projects, for detailed design principals, operation and tutorials and those patterns it is best to review information directly from those projects.

1. [Project Cobalt](https://github.com/microsoft/cobalt)
2. [Project Bedrock](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock)

## Getting Started

__Prerequisites__

* [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) installed or alternately [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/).

  >Assumes CLI Version = azure-cli (2.0.75)

__Execute Install Script__

The script ./scripts/install.sh will conveniently setup the common things that are necessary to execute a pipeline.

```bash
cd scripts
ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<your_subscription>" ./install.sh
```

### Installed Common Resources

1. Resource Group
2. Storage Account
3. Key Vault
4. Service Principal (Elevated)
5. 2 Applications for Integration Testing

__Setup a Elevated Permissions Service Principal__

The installed service principal `osdu-deploy-XXX` must now be given access to the following API's.

    - Azure Active Directory Graph - Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy
    - Microsoft Graph - Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy

__Elastic Search Setup__

Elastic Search Service is required by the Infrastructure and information must be stored in the KeyVault.

```bash
# NOTE: UNIQUE is the 3 digit Random Number assigned
VAULT="osdu-kv-${UNIQUE}"
ENV="int"
az keyvault secret set --vault-name $VAULT --name "elastic-endpoint-ado-${ENV}" --value <ed_endpoint>
az keyvault secret set --vault-name $VAULT --name "elastic-username-ado-${ENV}" --value <es_username>
az keyvault secret set --vault-name $VAULT --name "elastic-password-ado-${ENV}" --value <es_password>

# Dump to Output all secrets
for i in `az keyvault secret list --vault-name $VAULT | jq  --raw-output '.[]|(.id / "/")[4]'`
do 
  az keyvault secret show --vault-name $VAULT --name $i 
done | jq --raw-output '[(.id / "/")[4], .value] | join("=")'

az keyvault secret show --name "ExamplePassword" --vault-name "Contoso-Vault2"
```
