# osdu-infrastructure

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/azure/osdu-infrastructure)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/azure/osdu-infrastructure)

This project is an implementation of the Infrastructure as Code and Pipelines necessary to build and deploy the required infrastructure necessary for the [Open Subsurface Data Universe](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu) (OSDU).  Project Development for this code base is performed and maintained on osdu-infrastructure in [GitHub](http://github.com/azure/osdu-infrastructure) with a mirrored copy located in [GitLab](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform/deployment-and-operations/infrastructure-templates).

All patterns for this have been built and leverage to Microsoft Projects, for detailed design principals, operation and tutorials and those patterns it is best to review information directly from those projects.

2. [Project Bedrock](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock)

## BootStrap a Pipeline

_Eventually a bootstrap process will be handled by an [ado terraform provider](https://github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-azuredevops) but for now this is a manual process._

__Prerequisites__

* [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) installed or alternately [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/).

  >Assumes CLI Version = azure-cli (2.0.75)

__Execute Install Script__

The script ./scripts/install.sh will conveniently setup the common things that are necessary to execute a pipeline.


```bash
cd scripts
./install.sh <your_subscription> <unique_alphanumeric>
```

### Installed Common Resources 

1. Resource Group
2. Storage Account
3. Key Vault
4. Service Principal (Elevated)
5. Applications for Integration Testing (2)

__Setup an Elevated Permissions Service Principal__

The installed service principal must now be given access to the following API's.
> This task requires AD Tenant Grant Admin Consent privileges.

    - Azure Active Directory Graph - Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy
    - Microsoft Graph - Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy

__Elastic Search Setup__

Elastic Search Service is required by the Infrastructure and information must be stored in the Common KeyVault.

```bash
VAULT="<your_keyvault>"
ENV="int"
az keyvault secret set --vault-name $VAULT --name "elastic-endpoint-ado-${ENV}" --value <ed_endpoint>
az keyvault secret set --vault-name $VAULT --name "elastic-username-ado-${ENV}" --value <es_username>
az keyvault secret set --vault-name $VAULT --name "elastic-password-ado-${ENV}" --value <es_password>

# Dump all secrets to output
for i in `az keyvault secret list --vault-name $VAULT --query [].id -otsv`
do
   echo "export ${i##*/}=\"$(az keyvault secret show --vault-name $VAULT --id $i --query value -otsv)\""
done
```

### Configure Azure DevOps

_XXX refers to ${UNIQUE} and <your_env_name> without pipeline modification is `int`_

1. Create a new ADO Project in your organization called `osdu-r2`
2. Import the osdu-infrastructure to the ADO Project Repo from this URL `https://github.com/Azure/osdu-infrastructure.git`
3. Checkout the R2 Release Branch
4. Configure an ARM Resources Service Connection (Manual) with the Service Principal `osdu-deploy-XXX`
5. Setup and Configure the ADO Library `Infrastructure Pipeline Variables`
    - AGENT_POOL = `Hosted Ubuntu 1604`
    - BUILD_ARTIFACT_NAME = `infra-templates`
    - SERVICE_CONNECTION_NAME = `osdu-deploy-XXX`
    - TF_VAR_elasticsearch_secrets_keyvault_name = `osdu-kv-XXX`
    - TF_VAR_elasticsearch_secrets_keyvault_resource_group = `osdu-common-XXX`
    - TF_VAR_remote_state_account = `osdustateXXX`
    - TF_VAR_remote_state_container = `remote-state-container`
6. Setup and Configure the ADO Library `Infrastructure Pipeline Variables - <your_env_name>`
    - ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = `<your_subscription_id>`
    - TF_VAR_cosmosdb_replica_location = `eastus2`
    - TF_VAR_resource_group_location = `centralus`
7. Setup and Configure the ADO Library `Infrastructure Pipeline Secrets - <your_env_name>`
    > This should be linked Secrets from Azure Key Vault `osdu-kv-XXX`
    - elastic-endpoint-ado-<your_env_name> = `*********`
    - elastic-username-ado-<your_env_name> = `*********`
    - elastic-password-ado-<your_env_name> = `*********`
8. Setup 2 Secure Files
    > This is for future AKS work but the keys will be located after running install.sh in the scripts/.ssh directory
    - azure-aks-gitops-ssh-key
    - azure-aks-node-ssh-key.pub
9. Create a New Azure Pipeline from the Azure Repo using the pipeline `/devops/infrastructure/pipeline-integration.yml`
10. Run the Pipeline and the Infrastructure will deploy
